`leetcode_functions.py` it is the function created by Me i.e Chandrashekhar Robbi
It has various features like
* it takes input of the name of the problem**(there should not be any spelling mistake)** and returns the leetcode link for that problem 
* Convert the next cell into markdown
* Copies the markdown to clipboard
      * It contains main markdown tag along with
              * `Approach` and `Time Complexity` labels
